Hi, this is a sample code to launch a web app in AWS cloud

all you need is to have terraform installed in your computer and add your AWS credentials in lines 3 & 4 

then, proceed with the following commands in terminal:
    - terraform init
    - terraform apply

lastly, SSH into your instance and cd to /var/www/html to put in your source code (i would suggest use wget command to your github code)
